            "A human being is a part of a whole, called by us _universe_,
    a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his
    thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest...
    a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion
    is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal
    desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.
    Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening
    our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and
    the whole of nature in its beauty."
          </p>
